# NPC Tracker

Hello! The goal of this README is to inform you about my site, NPCTracker.com
![Dungeon and Dragon ICON](images/dndbanner_sm.png)

## Goal

The goal of this website is to allow Dungeon Master's (DM) for Dungeon and Dragons (DnD) to easily track NPC's. The goal is to allow them to keep track not only via the NPC's name but also via the campaign.

## Audience

The primary audience of this website is for DM's who primarily run multiple campaigns at one time. Though this will be equally useful for DM's who only run one campaign. 
The secondary audience is the players of DnD. These players will greatly benefit from the DM's ability to portray multiple NPCs in a consistent manner.
